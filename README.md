# Linux Commands
I am creating a copy of some Linux commands in Rust as part of my Rust journey.
For each command, I am implementing only the core functionality that I need for my own purposes, rather than replicating the full feature set of the original command.

## Finnished Commands

- cat

## Fture Commands

- ls
- ping
- mv
- cp
- neofetch ?
